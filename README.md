This is a forked project. I juste wanted to see how the game would look like with a wider neighboor.
It seems to me that this version is really hard to play.

Instead of looking only one square around the bomb (creating a 3x3 squar around the bomb), it also looks one layer wider (creating a 5x5 square around the bomb)

Defaults to 10 of each.
